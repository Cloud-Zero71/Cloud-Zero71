- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cloud-Zero71, I'm new to GitHub and I just finished a college degree in Computer Science.

- 👀 I’m interested in: 

	Learning how to becoming good at a few programming language. To learn how to use it to do creative work as well learn how to create websites using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:

	At the moment I'm currently take a class on Udemy called Complete Beginner's Guide to Python for 100 days by Dr. Angela Yu. There are also classes on Skillshare I may check out as well that focus on programming. Although I am also taking time to learn how to get better at drawing especially digital art. I might check out animation one day. 


- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:

	I would say nothing as of yet but I'm sure that will change as I get more involved in programming or software development.
